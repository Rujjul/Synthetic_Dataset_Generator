🎲 Synthetic Dataset Generator

A constraint-aware synthetic dataset generator powered by Meta Llama 3.1 (8B Instruct), optimized using 4-bit quantization, and deployed with an interactive Gradio UI on Google Colab (T4 GPU).

This tool allows users to generate structured, row-wise JSON datasets by simply describing columns and constraints in natural language.
